0	3520	At the time that you started working in computer music,
3520	6240	most computer usage was for purposes
6240	9680	like accounting and ballistics calculations.
9680	12800	What made you even think of using computers
12800	14600	as a creative tool?
14600	18600	I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years
18600	22680	studying in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who
22680	28440	was a well-known teacher and people such as Aaron Copland.
28480	32120	Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.
32120	37360	So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.
37360	42160	But as important to my own education as Nadia Boulanger
42160	45720	was the musical scene in general in Paris,
45720	50200	Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,
50200	54440	often referred to in such a way, in Paris
54440	59400	and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,
59400	62000	in which he presented new music, much of which
62000	64880	had to do with loudspeakers, electronic music,
64880	68400	made by the various kinds of devices
68400	72920	that one found in radio studios broadcasting in those days,
72920	76040	oscillators, filters, things that could be turned
76040	81520	to musical uses by composers if given the opportunity
81520	84320	to work in some of these studios.
84360	89320	So when I came to Stanford, having had this rich experience
89320	92640	in Europe, I, as a graduate student,
92640	95800	I asked if there were possibilities for such
95800	97920	and there were none.
97920	99240	There was no studio.
99240	102600	There was poor electronic music, the only one
102600	105560	that I knew of in this country was at Columbia at that time.
105560	109440	In any case, my second year of graduate school,
109440	114160	my graduate studies with Leland Smith in composition
114160	118160	or not musicology is noted in the book, but rather
118160	120880	I'm a composer by training.
120880	125120	I was given an article that Max Matthews had written.
125120	127960	Max was a researcher at Bell Labs,
127960	131360	director of the Behavioral Research Lab.
131360	136760	And his interests not only were engineering and engineering
136760	138360	sciences, but also music.
138360	142440	And he had developed a program called
142440	144880	which allowed computers to be used
144880	147440	to generate acoustic signals.
147440	150760	This, of course, was of interest in the scientific community
150760	155560	for speech research, but Max's interests were in music.
155560	158680	And he wrote this article published in Science
158680	163560	and in November 1963 describing this program.
163560	166400	So that was the beginning.
166400	169360	Now in the very beginning of electronic music,
169360	172360	the electronics we're talking about were actually analog.
172560	177400	By the timing of your start in the electronic music field,
177400	179920	you managed to get in on the ground floor
179920	183120	of digital electronic music.
183120	185240	In the very beginning, access to computers
185240	187160	must have been a very big problem.
187160	188720	Well, it was.
188720	193040	But Stanford had a kind of open view toward this
193040	197480	and had made an invitation to the School of Humanities
197480	201160	to look at computers and possible applications.
201200	205200	So there was a coincidence that was my good fortune, that is,
205200	208720	having looked at this article by Max,
208720	213160	also realizing that the computer science department, which
213160	216240	was then part of the School of Humanities and Sciences,
216240	221440	was open to uses other than the sort of applications
221440	223520	which you described at the outset.
223520	229840	So I met a young undergraduate, David Pool, who
229840	232640	was a tuba player in the orchestra, Stanford Orchestra.
232640	238680	I was the tympanist at the time of 30-year-old graduate student.
238680	242720	David was probably a 19 or 20-year-old undergraduate.
242720	245640	He saw me at the computer center one day
245640	248680	holding a big box of IBM cards, which I had acquired
248680	252240	from Max at Bell Labs, and asked what I was doing.
252240	257520	And I told him that I was going to try and implement
257520	263160	this program on the computer system at Stanford.
263160	266480	And he jumped in and offered to help me.
266480	271880	I think without David, I may not have been successful
271880	275320	in these early years because it was laborious.
275320	276400	It was difficult.
276400	281320	One had to have fairly comprehensive understanding
281320	283000	of how computers work.
283000	285360	My last math course had been in high school,
285360	289880	so it was a long way for me to, let's say,
289880	291760	would have been a bit of a stretch for me
291760	295320	to have accomplished this all by myself.
295320	298760	So David taught me basically all that I needed to know
298760	301680	through over the course of several years.
301680	304880	He got the program going, taught me how to program,
304880	308240	taught me the basics of acoustics, all the things
308240	310080	that I needed to understand in order
310080	313280	to begin work with the computer.
313280	315920	Now, it turns out that his solution
315920	319960	to getting continuous data stream of samples
319960	324440	from a big IBM 7090 to a digital analog converter,
324440	329000	which was actually the two ladders, the XY coordinates
329000	330880	of a dex scope.
330880	333880	This continuous data stream in order not
333880	338840	to have small segments of sound, but rather continuous sound,
338840	342800	turned out to be a solution to increasing
342800	349240	the number of timeshare users on this PDP-1 deck timesharing
349240	352880	system, which I think supported two or three users.
352880	358080	And David's solution to the problem of data bandwidth
358080	362080	and continuous samples also solved their problem
362080	363720	for fast swapping.
363720	367680	And as I remember, the number of users after he did that
367680	371160	went from two or three to eight or 10, something that sort.
371160	374560	So he became a very important part
374560	378400	of the artificial intelligence laboratory.
378400	381280	He finished his graduate work and then went on
381280	385240	and did some, finished his undergraduate, I'm sorry,
385240	386680	then did some graduate work.
386680	390440	But he basically became kind of the system guru
390440	397080	of the lab that John McCarthy directed in the early years.
397080	400200	When you came to Stanford then, you did not immediately
400200	402280	go to the AI lab.
402280	404840	That was subsequent in your career.
404840	407720	When did you go from the regular campus to the AI lab?
407720	411600	And given that you were a professor of music at that point,
411600	414480	rather than a professor of math or computer science,
414480	416640	what motivated you to move out there?
416640	419760	I was a graduate student actually until 1966
419760	421360	when I finished my doctorate.
421360	428240	But the initial work was done at the computer center on campus
428240	434280	on a PDP-1, which shared a 2314 disk with an IBM 7090.
434280	441800	And in 1966 is when the AI project acquired a PDP-6, which
441800	447880	was a large machine, timeshared, and moved to the DC Power
447880	451240	Laboratory on the Rastrodero Road.
451240	456880	And it was then that I started teaching as well that year.
456880	460640	Your move to the sale facility then out on Rastrodero Road
460640	464360	was motivated in large part by your desire
464360	467560	to have access to the computing resources there.
467560	470080	Did you have a lot of contact with the faculty
470080	473560	who were doing the more hardcore computer science research,
473560	478360	like robotics or formal proofs of computer programs?
478360	479080	Yes, I did.
479080	481280	I mean, it was one community of people,
481280	485720	some having more stature than others, I'd say.
485760	487680	I was not funded.
487680	491960	And the work that I did, and also with Leland Smith,
491960	496480	who joined me in this work, who had been my composition
496480	505680	professor then in 1966, senior colleague, we were unsupported.
505680	508400	So therefore, we were constrained in the hours
508400	512960	in which we could use the system to weekends and nights,
512960	516880	and I would say some very late nights.
516880	521240	But there was one researcher, Raj Reddy,
521240	524040	who went on to Carnegie Mellon, and I think
524040	527120	director of their robotics lab, who at that time
527120	529800	was working in speech recognition.
529800	534760	And he and I, of course, had some common interest
534760	539200	in that we were both interested in the acoustic domain.
539200	542720	So that was a rich connection.
542720	548440	I must say, I used the body of people at the AI lab
548440	549640	to my own advantage.
549640	553160	I was able to ask many people, many questions,
553160	557000	and get good, solid answers about things
557000	558840	that were common knowledge to those
558840	561520	who were educated in the sciences.
561520	566720	And so it was a very rich environment, from my point of view.
566720	568760	I think of all the people, probably David Poole
568800	573280	was the most important, but in my own particular work,
573280	575960	because he wrote a special compiler that
575960	580960	was native to the PDP6, PDP10 family of computers.
580960	585160	And in doing that, he taught me programming and assembly
585160	588160	language, whatnot, and sort of shepherded me
588160	592040	through the life at the AI lab, protecting me
592040	597760	from occasionally arrogant scientists who would have
597760	600200	liked less competition for compute cycles.
600200	604000	But in general, it was a pretty nice environment
604000	606880	and supportive, I would say.
