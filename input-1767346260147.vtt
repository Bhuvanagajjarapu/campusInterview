00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
At the time that you started working in computer music,

00:03.520 --> 00:06.240
most computer usage was for purposes

00:06.240 --> 00:09.680
like accounting and ballistics calculations.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.800
What made you even think of using computers

00:12.800 --> 00:14.600
as a creative tool?

00:14.600 --> 00:18.600
I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years

00:18.600 --> 00:22.680
studying in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who

00:22.680 --> 00:28.440
was a well-known teacher and people such as Aaron Copland.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.120
Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.

00:32.120 --> 00:37.360
So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.

00:37.360 --> 00:42.160
But as important to my own education as Nadia Boulanger

00:42.160 --> 00:45.720
was the musical scene in general in Paris,

00:45.720 --> 00:50.200
Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,

00:50.200 --> 00:54.440
often referred to in such a way, in Paris

00:54.440 --> 00:59.400
and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,

00:59.400 --> 01:02.000
in which he presented new music, much of which

01:02.000 --> 01:04.880
had to do with loudspeakers, electronic music,

01:04.880 --> 01:08.400
made by the various kinds of devices

01:08.400 --> 01:12.920
that one found in radio studios broadcasting in those days,

01:12.920 --> 01:16.040
oscillators, filters, things that could be turned

01:16.040 --> 01:21.520
to musical uses by composers if given the opportunity

01:21.520 --> 01:24.320
to work in some of these studios.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.320
So when I came to Stanford, having had this rich experience

01:29.320 --> 01:32.640
in Europe, I, as a graduate student,

01:32.640 --> 01:35.800
I asked if there were possibilities for such

01:35.800 --> 01:37.920
and there were none.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.240
There was no studio.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.600
There was poor electronic music, the only one

01:42.600 --> 01:45.560
that I knew of in this country was at Columbia at that time.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.440
In any case, my second year of graduate school,

01:49.440 --> 01:54.160
my graduate studies with Leland Smith in composition

01:54.160 --> 01:58.160
or not musicology is noted in the book, but rather

01:58.160 --> 02:00.880
I'm a composer by training.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.120
I was given an article that Max Matthews had written.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.960
Max was a researcher at Bell Labs,

02:07.960 --> 02:11.360
director of the Behavioral Research Lab.

02:11.360 --> 02:16.760
And his interests not only were engineering and engineering

02:16.760 --> 02:18.360
sciences, but also music.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.440
And he had developed a program called

02:22.440 --> 02:24.880
which allowed computers to be used

02:24.880 --> 02:27.440
to generate acoustic signals.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.760
This, of course, was of interest in the scientific community

02:30.760 --> 02:35.560
for speech research, but Max's interests were in music.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.680
And he wrote this article published in Science

02:38.680 --> 02:43.560
and in November 1963 describing this program.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.400
So that was the beginning.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.360
Now in the very beginning of electronic music,

02:49.360 --> 02:52.360
the electronics we're talking about were actually analog.

02:52.560 --> 02:57.400
By the timing of your start in the electronic music field,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.920
you managed to get in on the ground floor

02:59.920 --> 03:03.120
of digital electronic music.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.240
In the very beginning, access to computers

03:05.240 --> 03:07.160
must have been a very big problem.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.720
Well, it was.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.040
But Stanford had a kind of open view toward this

03:13.040 --> 03:17.480
and had made an invitation to the School of Humanities

03:17.480 --> 03:21.160
to look at computers and possible applications.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.200
So there was a coincidence that was my good fortune, that is,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.720
having looked at this article by Max,

03:28.720 --> 03:33.160
also realizing that the computer science department, which

03:33.160 --> 03:36.240
was then part of the School of Humanities and Sciences,

03:36.240 --> 03:41.440
was open to uses other than the sort of applications

03:41.440 --> 03:43.520
which you described at the outset.

03:43.520 --> 03:49.840
So I met a young undergraduate, David Pool, who

03:49.840 --> 03:52.640
was a tuba player in the orchestra, Stanford Orchestra.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.680
I was the tympanist at the time of 30-year-old graduate student.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.720
David was probably a 19 or 20-year-old undergraduate.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.640
He saw me at the computer center one day

04:05.640 --> 04:08.680
holding a big box of IBM cards, which I had acquired

04:08.680 --> 04:12.240
from Max at Bell Labs, and asked what I was doing.

04:12.240 --> 04:17.520
And I told him that I was going to try and implement

04:17.520 --> 04:23.160
this program on the computer system at Stanford.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.480
And he jumped in and offered to help me.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.880
I think without David, I may not have been successful

04:31.880 --> 04:35.320
in these early years because it was laborious.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.400
It was difficult.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.320
One had to have fairly comprehensive understanding

04:41.320 --> 04:43.000
of how computers work.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.360
My last math course had been in high school,

04:45.360 --> 04:49.880
so it was a long way for me to, let's say,

04:49.880 --> 04:51.760
would have been a bit of a stretch for me

04:51.760 --> 04:55.320
to have accomplished this all by myself.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.760
So David taught me basically all that I needed to know

04:58.760 --> 05:01.680
through over the course of several years.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.880
He got the program going, taught me how to program,

05:04.880 --> 05:08.240
taught me the basics of acoustics, all the things

05:08.240 --> 05:10.080
that I needed to understand in order

05:10.080 --> 05:13.280
to begin work with the computer.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.920
Now, it turns out that his solution

05:15.920 --> 05:19.960
to getting continuous data stream of samples

05:19.960 --> 05:24.440
from a big IBM 7090 to a digital analog converter,

05:24.440 --> 05:29.000
which was actually the two ladders, the XY coordinates

05:29.000 --> 05:30.880
of a dex scope.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.880
This continuous data stream in order not

05:33.880 --> 05:38.840
to have small segments of sound, but rather continuous sound,

05:38.840 --> 05:42.800
turned out to be a solution to increasing

05:42.800 --> 05:49.240
the number of timeshare users on this PDP-1 deck timesharing

05:49.240 --> 05:52.880
system, which I think supported two or three users.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.080
And David's solution to the problem of data bandwidth

05:58.080 --> 06:02.080
and continuous samples also solved their problem

06:02.080 --> 06:03.720
for fast swapping.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.680
And as I remember, the number of users after he did that

06:07.680 --> 06:11.160
went from two or three to eight or 10, something that sort.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.560
So he became a very important part

06:14.560 --> 06:18.400
of the artificial intelligence laboratory.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.280
He finished his graduate work and then went on

06:21.280 --> 06:25.240
and did some, finished his undergraduate, I'm sorry,

06:25.240 --> 06:26.680
then did some graduate work.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.440
But he basically became kind of the system guru

06:30.440 --> 06:37.080
of the lab that John McCarthy directed in the early years.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.200
When you came to Stanford then, you did not immediately

06:40.200 --> 06:42.280
go to the AI lab.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.840
That was subsequent in your career.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.720
When did you go from the regular campus to the AI lab?

06:47.720 --> 06:51.600
And given that you were a professor of music at that point,

06:51.600 --> 06:54.480
rather than a professor of math or computer science,

06:54.480 --> 06:56.640
what motivated you to move out there?

06:56.640 --> 06:59.760
I was a graduate student actually until 1966

06:59.760 --> 07:01.360
when I finished my doctorate.

07:01.360 --> 07:08.240
But the initial work was done at the computer center on campus

07:08.240 --> 07:14.280
on a PDP-1, which shared a 2314 disk with an IBM 7090.

07:14.280 --> 07:21.800
And in 1966 is when the AI project acquired a PDP-6, which

07:21.800 --> 07:27.880
was a large machine, timeshared, and moved to the DC Power

07:27.880 --> 07:31.240
Laboratory on the Rastrodero Road.

07:31.240 --> 07:36.880
And it was then that I started teaching as well that year.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.640
Your move to the sale facility then out on Rastrodero Road

07:40.640 --> 07:44.360
was motivated in large part by your desire

07:44.360 --> 07:47.560
to have access to the computing resources there.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.080
Did you have a lot of contact with the faculty

07:50.080 --> 07:53.560
who were doing the more hardcore computer science research,

07:53.560 --> 07:58.360
like robotics or formal proofs of computer programs?

07:58.360 --> 07:59.080
Yes, I did.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.280
I mean, it was one community of people,

08:01.280 --> 08:05.720
some having more stature than others, I'd say.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.680
I was not funded.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.960
And the work that I did, and also with Leland Smith,

08:11.960 --> 08:16.480
who joined me in this work, who had been my composition

08:16.480 --> 08:25.680
professor then in 1966, senior colleague, we were unsupported.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.400
So therefore, we were constrained in the hours

08:28.400 --> 08:32.960
in which we could use the system to weekends and nights,

08:32.960 --> 08:36.880
and I would say some very late nights.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.240
But there was one researcher, Raj Reddy,

08:41.240 --> 08:44.040
who went on to Carnegie Mellon, and I think

08:44.040 --> 08:47.120
director of their robotics lab, who at that time

08:47.120 --> 08:49.800
was working in speech recognition.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.760
And he and I, of course, had some common interest

08:54.760 --> 08:59.200
in that we were both interested in the acoustic domain.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.720
So that was a rich connection.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.440
I must say, I used the body of people at the AI lab

09:08.440 --> 09:09.640
to my own advantage.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.160
I was able to ask many people, many questions,

09:13.160 --> 09:17.000
and get good, solid answers about things

09:17.000 --> 09:18.840
that were common knowledge to those

09:18.840 --> 09:21.520
who were educated in the sciences.

09:21.520 --> 09:26.720
And so it was a very rich environment, from my point of view.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.760
I think of all the people, probably David Poole

09:28.800 --> 09:33.280
was the most important, but in my own particular work,

09:33.280 --> 09:35.960
because he wrote a special compiler that

09:35.960 --> 09:40.960
was native to the PDP6, PDP10 family of computers.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.160
And in doing that, he taught me programming and assembly

09:45.160 --> 09:48.160
language, whatnot, and sort of shepherded me

09:48.160 --> 09:52.040
through the life at the AI lab, protecting me

09:52.040 --> 09:57.760
from occasionally arrogant scientists who would have

09:57.760 --> 10:00.200
liked less competition for compute cycles.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.000
But in general, it was a pretty nice environment

10:04.000 --> 10:06.880
and supportive, I would say.
