1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
At the time that you started working in computer music,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
most computer usage was for purposes

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,680
like accounting and ballistics calculations.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,800
What made you even think of using computers

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,600
as a creative tool?

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,680
studying in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,440
was a well-known teacher and people such as Aaron Copland.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,120
Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,360
So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
But as important to my own education as Nadia Boulanger

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,720
was the musical scene in general in Paris,

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,200
Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,440
often referred to in such a way, in Paris

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,400
and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,000
in which he presented new music, much of which

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,880
had to do with loudspeakers, electronic music,

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,400
made by the various kinds of devices

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,920
that one found in radio studios broadcasting in those days,

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,040
oscillators, filters, things that could be turned

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,520
to musical uses by composers if given the opportunity

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
to work in some of these studios.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,320
So when I came to Stanford, having had this rich experience

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,640
in Europe, I, as a graduate student,

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,800
I asked if there were possibilities for such

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,920
and there were none.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
There was no studio.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,600
There was poor electronic music, the only one

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
that I knew of in this country was at Columbia at that time.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,440
In any case, my second year of graduate school,

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,160
my graduate studies with Leland Smith in composition

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
or not musicology is noted in the book, but rather

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm a composer by training.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,120
I was given an article that Max Matthews had written.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Max was a researcher at Bell Labs,

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,360
director of the Behavioral Research Lab.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,760
And his interests not only were engineering and engineering

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
sciences, but also music.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,440
And he had developed a program called

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,880
which allowed computers to be used

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,440
to generate acoustic signals.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,760
This, of course, was of interest in the scientific community

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,560
for speech research, but Max's interests were in music.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,680
And he wrote this article published in Science

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,560
and in November 1963 describing this program.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,400
So that was the beginning.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Now in the very beginning of electronic music,

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
the electronics we're talking about were actually analog.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,400
By the timing of your start in the electronic music field,

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,920
you managed to get in on the ground floor

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
of digital electronic music.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,240
In the very beginning, access to computers

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,160
must have been a very big problem.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
Well, it was.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
But Stanford had a kind of open view toward this

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,480
and had made an invitation to the School of Humanities

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,160
to look at computers and possible applications.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
So there was a coincidence that was my good fortune, that is,

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
having looked at this article by Max,

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,160
also realizing that the computer science department, which

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,240
was then part of the School of Humanities and Sciences,

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,440
was open to uses other than the sort of applications

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,520
which you described at the outset.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,840
So I met a young undergraduate, David Pool, who

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
was a tuba player in the orchestra, Stanford Orchestra.

66
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,680
I was the tympanist at the time of 30-year-old graduate student.

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,720
David was probably a 19 or 20-year-old undergraduate.

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,640
He saw me at the computer center one day

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,680
holding a big box of IBM cards, which I had acquired

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,240
from Max at Bell Labs, and asked what I was doing.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,520
And I told him that I was going to try and implement

72
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,160
this program on the computer system at Stanford.

73
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,480
And he jumped in and offered to help me.

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,880
I think without David, I may not have been successful

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,320
in these early years because it was laborious.

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
It was difficult.

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,320
One had to have fairly comprehensive understanding

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
of how computers work.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,360
My last math course had been in high school,

80
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,880
so it was a long way for me to, let's say,

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,760
would have been a bit of a stretch for me

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,320
to have accomplished this all by myself.

83
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,760
So David taught me basically all that I needed to know

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,680
through over the course of several years.

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,880
He got the program going, taught me how to program,

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,240
taught me the basics of acoustics, all the things

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
that I needed to understand in order

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
to begin work with the computer.

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,920
Now, it turns out that his solution

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,960
to getting continuous data stream of samples

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,440
from a big IBM 7090 to a digital analog converter,

92
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,000
which was actually the two ladders, the XY coordinates

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
of a dex scope.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,880
This continuous data stream in order not

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,840
to have small segments of sound, but rather continuous sound,

96
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,800
turned out to be a solution to increasing

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,240
the number of timeshare users on this PDP-1 deck timesharing

98
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,880
system, which I think supported two or three users.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,080
And David's solution to the problem of data bandwidth

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
and continuous samples also solved their problem

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
for fast swapping.

102
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,680
And as I remember, the number of users after he did that

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,160
went from two or three to eight or 10, something that sort.

104
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,560
So he became a very important part

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
of the artificial intelligence laboratory.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
He finished his graduate work and then went on

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,240
and did some, finished his undergraduate, I'm sorry,

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,680
then did some graduate work.

109
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,440
But he basically became kind of the system guru

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,080
of the lab that John McCarthy directed in the early years.

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,200
When you came to Stanford then, you did not immediately

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,280
go to the AI lab.

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,840
That was subsequent in your career.

114
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,720
When did you go from the regular campus to the AI lab?

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,600
And given that you were a professor of music at that point,

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,480
rather than a professor of math or computer science,

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
what motivated you to move out there?

118
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,760
I was a graduate student actually until 1966

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
when I finished my doctorate.

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,240
But the initial work was done at the computer center on campus

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,280
on a PDP-1, which shared a 2314 disk with an IBM 7090.

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,800
And in 1966 is when the AI project acquired a PDP-6, which

123
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,880
was a large machine, timeshared, and moved to the DC Power

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,240
Laboratory on the Rastrodero Road.

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,880
And it was then that I started teaching as well that year.

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,640
Your move to the sale facility then out on Rastrodero Road

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,360
was motivated in large part by your desire

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,560
to have access to the computing resources there.

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,080
Did you have a lot of contact with the faculty

130
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
who were doing the more hardcore computer science research,

131
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,360
like robotics or formal proofs of computer programs?

132
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,080
Yes, I did.

133
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,280
I mean, it was one community of people,

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,720
some having more stature than others, I'd say.

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
I was not funded.

136
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,960
And the work that I did, and also with Leland Smith,

137
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,480
who joined me in this work, who had been my composition

138
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:25,680
professor then in 1966, senior colleague, we were unsupported.

139
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
So therefore, we were constrained in the hours

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,960
in which we could use the system to weekends and nights,

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,880
and I would say some very late nights.

142
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,240
But there was one researcher, Raj Reddy,

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,040
who went on to Carnegie Mellon, and I think

144
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,120
director of their robotics lab, who at that time

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,800
was working in speech recognition.

146
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,760
And he and I, of course, had some common interest

147
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,200
in that we were both interested in the acoustic domain.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
So that was a rich connection.

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,440
I must say, I used the body of people at the AI lab

150
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,640
to my own advantage.

151
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,160
I was able to ask many people, many questions,

152
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
and get good, solid answers about things

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
that were common knowledge to those

154
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,520
who were educated in the sciences.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,720
And so it was a very rich environment, from my point of view.

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,760
I think of all the people, probably David Poole

157
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,280
was the most important, but in my own particular work,

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,960
because he wrote a special compiler that

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,960
was native to the PDP6, PDP10 family of computers.

160
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,160
And in doing that, he taught me programming and assembly

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
language, whatnot, and sort of shepherded me

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,040
through the life at the AI lab, protecting me

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,760
from occasionally arrogant scientists who would have

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,200
liked less competition for compute cycles.

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,000
But in general, it was a pretty nice environment

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
and supportive, I would say.
